        <h1><center>Faulkner Spatial Biography and Database</center></h1>
        <h3><center>A Quick Flight Through Europe </center> </h3>
        <p>The following is a demo of the type of things a spatial biography can do. One of the main features is that it can move through time and space to reveal objects and people that share spatial relationship.</p>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>The map can be navigated in three ways: </p>
        <p><b>Temporaly</b> by <i>scrolling</i> up and down to follow Faulkner's travel route as he left Oxford to see Europe.</p>
        <p><b>Spatially</b> by <i>hovering</i> over the map and exploring different connections between Faulkner and the places and objects that surrounded him.</p>
        <p><b>Data-driven</b> by <i>clicking</i> on the buttons on the top left to see aggregate data insights about Faulkner's life across time and space, such as the people who wrote him letters and the provenance of the books he read.</p>
